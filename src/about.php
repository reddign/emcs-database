  The EMCS database was a project from the CS341 Software Engineering during the Fall of 2022. 
  During the first 4 weeks of class students worked as part of the EC🗲DZ software team using a Git repository to share code.  The students used their programming skills to add functionality to the software and practiced working as a agile software team.  Below is a picture of the students in the class and a detailed list of contributors.";
